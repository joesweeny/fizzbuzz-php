# Fizzbuzz PHP

I learned my first two languages, Ruby and Javascript, by starting with the FizzBuzz kata. Through repetition and practice this Kata enabled me to get a quick grasp on the syntax for the language and for testing.

I could not find any thorough PHP examples of FizzBuzz so I created my own. Feel free to clone or fork this repo and use it for your own learning requirements.

Instructions:
```
1) Ensure you have PHP installed on your machine (version 5.6.27 used for this example).
```
```
2) Ensure you have PHPUnit installed on your machine (version 5.6.1 used for this example).
```
```
3) Ensure you have Composer installed on your machine and run $ composer init
```
```
4) Add dependencies shown in composer.json file (see above) and run $ composer install
```
```
5) $ touch phpunit.xml and copy contents (see above) to show colours on your tests.
```
```
6) To run a test (for this example): $ phpunit fizzBuzzTest.php
```

FizzBuzz rules:
```
Lets divide this into different steps so, we can easily write and test this.
- Print numbers from 1 to 100
- Print "Fizz" instead of number which is divisible by 3
- Print "Buzz" instead of number which is divisible by 5
- Print "FizzBuzz" instead of number which is divisible by both 3 and 5
```

Happy FizzBuzz'ing
